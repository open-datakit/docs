Say you want to compare the results of two different analyses on the same set of
data. To do this, you can create a separate run for each analysis.

In this tutorial, we'll first modify our algorithm to calculate either the
median or the mean of the input dataset. We'll then create two runs - one to
calculate the median, and one the mean. This allows us to record and compare the
output of the two analyses.

## Modifying the algorithm

First, let's modify our algorithm to give us the option of calculating a median
instead of a mean.

Modify `helloworld/algorithm.py`:

```python title="helloworld/algorithm.py" ins=", function" ins="getattr(data, function)"
def main(data, function):
    """Take the average along the long axis with the specified function"""
    return {
        "result": getattr(data, function)(axis=1).to_frame(name="result"),
    }
```

Now wire up the new `function` argument to an input in `algorithm.json`:

```json title="helloworld/algorithm.json ins={10-29}
{
  "name": "helloworld",
  ...
  "signature": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "name": "data",
        ...
      },
      {
        "name": "function",
        "title": "Function",
        "description": "The function to use for averaging (mean or median)",
        "type": "string",
        "null": false,
        "enum": [
          {
            "title": "Mean",
            "value": "mean"
          },
          {
            "title": "Median",
            "value": "median"
          }
        ],
        "default": {
          "value": "mean"
        }
      }
    ],
    "outputs": [
      {
        "name": "result",
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here we're adding a simple input that takes a string, and specifying that it can
take only two valid values: `mean` and `median` with the `enum` property.

To see how this works, we can try and set our new input to the wrong value:

```bash
dk reset
dk init  # Ensure we initialise a new run to use the updated algorithm signature
dk set function "mode"
```

This should throw the following error:

```
Variable value must be one of ['mean', 'median']
```

However we can set the value to "median" with no issue:

```bash
dk set function "median"
```

## Creating a new run

Let's create a new run to find the median of this dataset.

```bash
dk reset  # Reset the datakit to a clean state again
dk init helloworld.median
```

This command tells the CLI tool that we want to create a new run named
`helloworld.median`. `helloworld` specifies the algorithm that we want to use
for this run, and `median` is a user-chosen name for the run. The algorithm name
before the period must match an algorithm listed in `datakit.json`. The string
following the period can be anything you like.

You can check which run is currently active by running:

```bash
dk get-run
```

### Executing the run

Let's find the median of our dataset. Run the following:

```bash
dk load data data/tabulardata.csv  # Load our data
dk set function "median"           # Set our calculation function to "median"
dk run                             # Run the algorithm
```

Your result should look like:

```bash
dk show result
```

| time | result   |
| ---- | -------- |
| 0    | 1.92299  |
| 1    | 0.309318 |
| 2    | 0.83881  |
| 3    | 3.8687   |
| 4    | 3.89235  |
| ...  | ...      |

## The run folder structure

Your datakit should now look like this:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- helloworld-datakit/
  - helloworld/
    - algorithm.json
    - algorithm.py
    - resources/
      - data.json
      - result.json
  - **helloworld.median.run/**
    - run.json
    - resources/
      - data.json
      - result.json
    - views/
  - datakit.json
</FileTree>

As you can see, the resources appear in both the run directory
(`helloworld.median.run`) and the algorithm definition directory (`helloworld`).

The resources inside the algorithm definition directory serve as templates from
which to generate the resources for a run.

The resources inside the run directory represent the actual inputs and outputs
that are recorded in the course of running an algorithm.

Additionally, `run.json` records the values of any single value variable during
a run (such as our new input variable - `function`).

In this way, a run folder contains a complete description of the state of a
single execution of the algorithm. This state can then be tracked in a version
control repository to maintain a history of the analysis performed. This is
covered in the next topic.

## Creating a second run

Now, say we want to calculate the mean of the same dataset without losing our
previous result. To do this, we can create a new named run:

```bash
dk init helloworld.mean
```

Now we can load our input data, and set the function we want to use to calculate
the result:

```bash
dk load data data/tabulardata.csv
dk set function "mean"
```

Your result should look like:

```bash
dk show result
```

| time | result   |
| ---- | -------- |
| 0    | 1.41565  |
| 1    | 0.567011 |
| 2    | 1.25404  |
| 3    | 3.81149  |
| 4    | 4.06375  |
| ...  | ...      |

Now, since we saved the result of our previous run in `helloworld.median`, we
can easily compare the two results:

```bash
dk set-run helloworld.median
dk show result  # Print the "median" run result
```

Here they are side by side:

| time | result (median) | result (mean) |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------- |
| 0    | 1.92299         | 1.41565       |
| 1    | 0.309318        | 0.567011      |
| 2    | 0.83881         | 1.25404       |
| 3    | 3.8687          | 3.81149       |
| 4    | 3.89235         | 4.06375       |
| ...  | ...             | ...           |
