This guide explains how to track datakit runs in a version control repository
using Git.

One of the key advantages of using datakits is the ability to version control
your entire analysis process. By tracking these changes with Git, every step of
your analysis becomes reproducible and shareable, allowing others with access to
your repository to replicate your work.

This is a brief introduction for those who are new to Git to get started with
tracking datakit changes.

## Installing Git

Before getting started, you'll need to install Git. Follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for your operating system.

## Initialising your repository

Once Git is installed, you can initialise your datakit as a Git repository:

```bash
cd helloworld-datakit       # Navigate to your datakit root folder
git init                        # Initialise a Git repository
```

Now we can check the status of your repository:

```bash
git status
```

You should see a list of "untracked files" - these are files Git is not yet
monitoring for changes.

Let's add and commit all files to start tracking them:

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Now, all files in your datakit are tracked. You can revert to this state at any
time if needed.

## Tracking changes

After running an analysis in your datakit, some files will be modified.

For example, if you run the following commands:

```bash
dk init
dk load data data/tabulardata.csv
dk run
```

Git will detect changes in your repository. You can check this by running:

```bash
git status
```

You might see output like this:

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   datakit.json

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        multipleruns.run/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Git has noticed changes, but they haven’t been committed yet. To save these
changes, use:

```bash
git commit -am "Put a description of your run here"
```

It's important to commit after each significant run you want to preserve. If you
don’t, your changes may not be saved and could be overwritten by subsequent
runs.

## Publishing to GitHub

To share your datakit or make it available publicly, you can upload your
repository to GitHub.

First, create a new repository on GitHub and copy its URL.

Now, link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-account/your-repository.git
```

Push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin mian
```

Your datakit is now published to GitHub and can be accessed by others if your
repository is set to public.
